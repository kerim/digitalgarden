# My Digital Toolkit

## Writing

New and Temporary Notes: [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/)

* Starts up with a blank note ready to start writing and has powerful scripting to process those notes, moving them to other apps to make todo lists, calendar appointments, or save text somewhere else.

Notes, wishlists, journal, ideas, research, etc.: [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/)

* Pretty much what I need, except for the fact that the iOS app is currently a web app which opens very slowly. That should be improved when there is an API so I can send things directly from drafts. Also, encryption is not great. Not currently taking fieldwork notes, but if I were I'd use DayOne again.

Private notes and image notes: [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) 

* Password protected with end-to-end encryption for sync. Useful for my private diary and fieldwork/research notes. I also save image notes, including name cards (processed using the Prizmo OCR app first), and pictures I need for reference (posters, book covers, schedules, etc.) 

Note archive: [FSNotes](https://fsnot.es/)

* Useful for quick access and easy tagging, with multiple folders for different topics.

Long form writing: [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) 

* Allows one to break up larger projects into smaller documents that are chained together, offers several ways to include inline comments, can set and track writing goals in terms of words or time to read a text aloud, and has sophisticated export options. Also offers some interface enhancements that are useful for long-form writing, such as a typewriter mode which keeps the cursor in the middle of the screen rather than at the bottom. Examples: conference papers, journal articles, larger manuscripts

Collaboration and journal-ready manuscripts: [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) 

* One of the easiest ways to share documents or spreadsheets. Not only does it support standard Microsoft file formats, but the suggested edits, track changes, and commenting features are very well implemented. For manuscript creation the real advantage comes from integration with Paperpile, my citation manager of choice. See below for more info about Paperpile. Examples: student work, co-authored grant proposals, getting feedback on my own writing, preparing a Ulysses written manuscript for publication.

## Files

Non-academic PDFs and web clips: [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) 

* No other app grabs whole web pages or selections of webpages as well as Evernote. Evernote also has excellent full text search of attached files, including PDFs. And the Scanable iOS app is a great way to quickly scan papers to PDF and save them to Evernote. Examples: receipts from web transactions, business cards, bills, medical records, etc.

Academic PDFs: [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/app)

* Paperpile is excellent at grabbing metadata about books and journal articles from almost any webpage or PDF. When used together with Google Docs (see above) it also does a great job at formatting in-text citations and bibliographies for publications. Finally, it is useful for collaboration with the ability to share libraries. The iOS app is in beta, but is already very useful. 

Reading/Annotating PDFs: [PDF Expert](https://pdfexpert.com/)

* Use on both iOS and the desktop, export my notes to plain text and then import to Dynalist for processing.

## Tasks

Personal tasks, Colloboration, Project Management: [Todoist](https://todoist.com) 

* There are many online collaborative task managers, but few that offer so many features for free, or which work if only one of the users has paid for a pro membership. Of these, Todoist is currently the best. It also works very well for grabbing websites as tasks via the Chrome extension or the iOS app, making it useful for bookmarking things that need to be checked off. 

## Other

Database/Spreadsheet: [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) 

Web articles to read later: [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) 

* There are a number of services to do this, with Pocket being the main competitor. Pocket is better in many ways, but Instapaper handles paywalled accounts better as well as the ability to export more than one highlight at a time which is invaluable for anyone who uses it for research. 

Blogging: [Blot](https://blot.im/)

* Stupidly simple blogging. Just put any file in a dropbox folder and it becomes a blog post! But there are many other features there if you need more!

    - Possible Replacements

        + [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/)

Transcription: [oTranscribe](https://otranscribe.com/)

* Free app for transcribing audio or video. Works in your browser, but your data stays local, not in "the cloud." Available in many languages.
